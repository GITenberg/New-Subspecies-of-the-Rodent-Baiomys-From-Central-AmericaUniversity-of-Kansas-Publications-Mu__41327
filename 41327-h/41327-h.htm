<h2>New Subspecies of the Rodent Baiomys From Central America</h2>

<p class="center">BY</p>

<p class="center">ROBERT L. PACKARD</p>

<p>The southern pygmy mouse, <i>Baiomys musculus</i>, is known as far north as
the Mexican states of Jalisco, Michoacán, south of the Mesa Central,
east to central Veracruz (see Hooper, 1952a:90), and south to western
Nicaragua (see Goodwin, 1942:161). Previously, two subspecies have been
recognized from the southern part of the known range of this species:
<i>B. m. nigrescens</i>, blackish mice from Chiapas, México, and Guatemala,
and <i>B. m. grisescens</i>, grayish-brown mice from Honduras and western
Nicaragua. Study of recently acquired specimens from Guatemala, El
Salvador, and Nicaragua reveals two additional subspecies.</p>

<p>For the loan of comparative material, I am grateful to the United States
National Museum (USNM) and the American Museum of Natural History
(AMNH). Unless otherwise indicated, specimens are in the University of
Kansas Museum of Natural History. Measurements are as taken by Hooper
(1952b:10). Postpalatal length is the distance from the posterior margin
of the hard palate to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. Unless
otherwise noted, statistical significance as used in this paper is at
the 95 per cent confidence limit or higher.</p>

<p>The two heretofore undescribed subspecies are characterized below and
may be known as:</p>

<p class="center"><b><i>Baiomys musculus handleyi</i></b>, new subspecies</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult female, USNM No. 275604 (Biological Surveys
Collection), skin and skull; from Sacapulas, El Quiché, Guatemala;
obtained on April 24, 1947, by Charles O. Handley, Jr., original
number 991.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;Known only from the type locality; probably
inhabits parts of the east-west drainage of the Río Negro.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;General ground color of upper parts between Wood
Brown and Buffy Brown (all capitalized color terms are those of
Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C.,
1912), dorsal parts of fore- and hind-feet, and ankles white; in
region of median venter, throat, and chin, hairs white to base; in
lateral regions hairs Neutral Gray at base; dorsal hairs below tips
Avellaneous, Neutral Gray at base; guard hairs black-tipped; tail
white below, brownish above; nasals truncate anteriorly;
frontalparietal suture forming an obtuse angle with median-parietal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span> suture; alveolar-length of upper molar tooth-row and tail long.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Baiomys musculus nigrescens</i> (paratypes, from
the Valley of Comitán, Chiapas, México), found to the north, <i>B. m.
handleyi</i> differs in: color paler dorsally and ventrally; fore- and
hind-feet whitish instead of dusky to sooty; hairs in region of
facial vibrissae white instead of brown; tail bicolored instead of
unicolored; anterior tips of nasals square, not rounded;
frontoparietal suture forming obtuse angle with median parietal
suture instead of a right angle; tail and alveolar length of upper
molar tooth-row significantly larger (see table 1); zygomatic
breadth, breadth of braincase, occipitonasal length, least
interorbital constriction, and length of rostrum all averaging
larger (see table 2).</p>

<p>From <i>Baiomys musculus grisescens</i> (paratypes, from Comayabuela,
to the south, <i>B. m. handleyi</i> differs in: buff-colored
hairs in dorsal and ventral region lacking; fore- and hind-feet
white, not flesh-colored with gray overtones; tail bicolored, not
unicolored; face paler, lacking buff-brown coloration; anterior
tips of nasals squared rather than flaring; tail and upper molar
tooth-row significantly longer (see Table 1); hind foot, ear from
notch, and rostrum longer; braincase averaging broader (see Table
2).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The occurrence of these pale mice in the Río Negro Valley
was first noted by Goodwin (1934:39, 40) when he referred specimens from
Sacapulas and Chanquejelve, Guatemala, to <i>B. m. musculus</i>. Hooper (<i>op.
cit.</i>:92-94) correctly assigned specimens from the southern coast and
eastern part of Chiapas to <i>B. m. nigrescens</i>. The continued assignment
of specimens from Sacapulas, Guatemala, to the subspecies <i>musculus</i>
produces a hiatus both in the range of <i>B. m. nigrescens</i> and <i>B. m.
musculus</i>. Twenty-four specimens, 14 from 1 mi. S Rabinal, and 10 from
1/2 mi. N, 1 mi. E Salama, Guatemala, are intergrades between <i>handleyi</i>
and <i>grisescens</i>, but show more resemblance to the latter and,
therefore, are referred to that subspecies. To the north, <i>handleyi</i>
intergrades with <i>nigrescens</i>. The specimen from Chanquejelve is an
intergrade between the two subspecies just mentioned.</p>

<p>Osgood suggested (1909:259) that the degree of relative humidity might
in some way control color of pelage in this species. Relative humidity
and its subsequent effect on other related environmental factors indeed
may account for the superficial resemblance of <i>B. m. musculus</i> to <i>B.
m. handleyi</i> (although <i>handleyi</i> averages paler throughout than the
paratypical series of <i>musculus</i>). Both subspecies inhabit relatively
arid country. According to Goodwin (<i>op. cit.</i>:39 and Plate 5, Fig. 1),
and Handley (<i>in verbis</i>), the Río Negro Valley in the vicinity of
Sacapulas is extremely hot, dry, and rather isolated. Extremes of
climate there may exceed those in the arid habitat occupied by <i>B. m.
musculus</i>. The resemblance between these two subspecies may result from
nearly parallel selective forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span> that have given rise to two distinct
subspecies. <i>B. m. handleyi</i> may have developed <i>in situ</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Total 49, from the type locality, including
the type (12, USNM; 37, AMNH).</p>

<p class="center"><b><i>Baiomys musculus pullus</i>,</b> new subspecies</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult female, skin and skull, University of Kansas Museum
of Natural History, No. 71605, from 8 mi. S Condega, Esteli,
Nicaragua; obtained on July 15, 1956, by A. A. Alcorn, original No.
4218.</p>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;West-central Nicaragua, from Matagalpa northwest
into the valley of the Río Esteli, east as far as Jinotega.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Dorsum Fuscus-Black (see remarks),
individual dorsal hairs being black-tipped with a subterminal
Ochraceous-Buff band, Neutral Gray at base; some hairs on dorsum
all black to Neutral Gray at base; hair on sides Neutral Gray
tinged with blackish; facial region blackish becoming more buffy
ventrally; vibrissae black; tail unicolored Chaetura Black; fore-
and hind-feet whitish to dusky-white; mid-ventral region of belly
white to as far anteriorly as region of throat, hairs being white
to base; in region of anus and throat, hairs white-tipped, Neutral
Gray at base; tail long; upper molar tooth-row short as in <i>B. m.
nigrescens</i>; zygoma bowed as in <i>B. m. grisescens</i>.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>B. m. grisescens</i> (paratypes from
Comayaguela, Honduras), <i>B. m. pullus</i> differs in: dorsal
ground-color and tail darker; sides and distal region of belly
grayish instead of buffy-brown, thus making white stripe in region
of belly distinct; average length of body and tail significantly
longer, thus, total length greater; length of hind foot averaging
longer (68 per cent confidence limits); alveolar length of upper
molar tooth-row significantly shorter; occipitonasal and rostral
length averaging longer; zygomatic spread and interorbital region
narrower; length of incisive foramina, depth of cranium,
postpalatal length, and breadth of braincase all averaging larger
(see table 2).</p>

<p>From <i>B. m. nigrescens</i> (paratypes from Valley of Comitán), <i>B. m.
pullus</i> differs in: dorsal ground-color slightly darker; facial
region grayish, not sooty; mid-ventral white stripe present on
belly and becoming grayish laterally; tail darker and less hairy,
average length significantly longer; body, occipitonasal length of
skull, incisive foramina, and postpalatal length averaging smaller;
hind foot shorter; zygomatic spread, interorbital region and
braincase broader (see table of measurements); cranium deeper.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>B. m. pullus</i> is the darkest dorsally of any subspecies of
this species. Dalquest (1953:156) pointed out that preserved specimens
of one of the subspecies of the northern pygmy mouse, <i>Baiomys taylori
taylori</i>, tended to fade considerably over a period of four years.
Post-mortem changes in color also are apparent in the southern species
<i>musculus</i>. For example, the series of specimens from 8 mi. S of
Condega, and 9 mi. NNW Esteli, Nicaragua, have faded from near Chaetura
Black to the present Fuscous-Black in a period of two years. The most
notable change in color came after the first six months of preservation.
Allowing for this fading, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span> several color differences between
<i>pullus</i>, <i>nigrescens</i> and <i>grisescens</i> are, nevertheless, distinctive.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
